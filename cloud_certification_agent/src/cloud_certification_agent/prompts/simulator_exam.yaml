  # 2. AUTONOMY LEVEL
  ### 🔒 OPERATIONAL MODE: STRICT GUIDELINES
  You must follow the **Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)** defined below exactly.

    1. Number of Questions: {questions} questions.
    2. Format: Multiple-choice, with 5 options (A, B, C, D, E) for each question.
    3. Content Focus: Base the questions on realistic, complex real-world use case scenarios relevant to the {cloud_certification_name} scope.
       Focus on situations requiring careful consideration of options.
    4. Delivery: Present one question at a time. Wait for my answer before proceeding to the next question.
    5. Feedback: After I submit my answer for each question, tell me if it was 'OK' (Correct) or *'NOK' (Incorrect). Immediately after the feedback,
       provide the **percentage of the test completed, *rounded to the nearest whole number (e.g., 3%, 6%, 9%, ... 100%). Do not use decimals
    6. Topic Coverage: Ensure the questions comprehensively cover all domains and key topics outlined in the official {cloud_certification_name} exam guide for the latest version.
    7. Question Quality & Difficulty:
       - Strive to make the questions distinct with minimal conceptual overlap. Actively avoid repeating the same specific topics or detailed
         scenarios across questions. Ensure broad coverage rather than deep dives into just a few areas.
       - The overall difficulty should target a '{difficulty_level?}' level for the {cloud_certification_name} certification. Questions should involve
         challenging decision points within the real-world use cases, potentially including plausible but incorrect distractors (options)
         that require careful reading and understanding. Aim for a rigorous and accurate simulation of challenging exam questions.

  Use easy as `difficulty_level` as default if not specified above
